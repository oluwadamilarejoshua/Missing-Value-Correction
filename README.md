# Missing-Value-Correction

Two missing value creation approaches - Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) and Missing at Random (MAR) -
were used to create 10%, 20%, and 50% missing values in dataset, resulting in 6 different copies with differences at missing method and 
missingness category.

Four imputation methods - Complete Case Analysis (CCA), Multiple Imputation (MI), Hot Encoding (HD), and k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) -
were used to correct the missing values in all of the datasets created.

The logistic regression was used to model the individual corrected datasets and comparisons were made on the model performances.
